## Bio
  
Hi! I'm a graduate student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
She is studying epidemiology with a focus on pharmacoepidemiology. I'm excited 
for future opportunities to learn more about drug development, safety, and utilization.

Outside of school, I love to run, sew, and cook. I'm originally from Southern 
California and I'm having so much fun exploring Baltimore!
